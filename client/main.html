    <h4>
      Epicenter is website where you can upload files that will be spread across
      other nodes connected to a mongo database. If you want to have files that
      are shared to other locations running an Epicenter application, you just
      need to connect to a shared MongoDB. On the backend, epicenter will create
      a swarm of data between all epicenter nodes by turning the uploaded file
      into a torrent, the torrent gets sent to MongoDb, and the other nodes
      begin add the torrent to a running instance of
      <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/download/">Transmission</a>.
      Currently, epicenter is supported on Windows, and Linux.
